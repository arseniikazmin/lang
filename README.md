# _lang_
_lang_ is a language learning program to learn and view words. All languages are divided into categories, i.e. food, colors, months, etc.

## Features
- Word learning
- Word viewing
- Adding words (not yet implemented)


## Languages currently available:
- Spanish ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½
- German ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª
- Turkish ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡·

## Installation
The game is a python script. It handles all the dependencies for you, however, if you'd like
to install all dependencies before running the script, run `pip3 install termcolor` (the `termcolor` module handles terminal colors).  
To uninstall it, run `pip3 uninstall termcolor`.  
In the future I might add an installation script but for now it is merely a python file you execute.
